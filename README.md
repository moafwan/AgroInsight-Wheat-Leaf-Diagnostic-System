# AgroInsight: Wheat Leaf Diagnostic System

The AgroInsight: Wheat Leaf Diagnostic System is a Flask-based web application designed to detect wheat leaf diseases using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.<br/> The system leverages machine learning to identify common diseases in wheat leaves, providing an efficient and accurate tool for farmers and agricultural experts to monitor crop health.<br/>

<b>Key Features:</b><br/>
-> Image Dataset Preprocessing:<br/>
The system uses carefully curated and preprocessed datasets of wheat leaf images to ensure accurate disease detection.<br/>
<br/>
->Disease Detection:<br/>
</t>Real-Time Detection:<br/>
</t></t>Users can perform real-time diagnostics using a webcam to capture live images of wheat leaves.</br>
</t>Image Upload:<br/>
</t></t>The application supports image uploads for detecting diseases in pre-captured images of wheat leaves.<br/>
<br/>
->CNN Model for Disease Classification:<br/>
The web application integrates a trained CNN model that classifies wheat leaf diseases with high accuracy.<br/>
<br/>

<b>Purpose:</b><br/>
The system is designed to assist farmers and agricultural specialists in identifying wheat leaf diseases at an early stage. By enabling real-time detection through webcam feeds and image uploads, the tool ensures efficient disease monitoring, helping improve crop yield and reduce losses due to disease outbreaks.
